### Abstract

The 2D platformer Toss It! An Unfrogettable Adventure is built around dynamic movement. The player has a tongue with special abilities: It can be used as a grappling hook or to drag boxes around. Furthermore, the boxes can be utilized to open doors or balance scales. By combining these abilities, the player's objective is to collect as many jars filled with flies as possible on their unfrogettable adventure in the deep jungle.
